ISSUES:

-There was a problem in HMR of parcel , so I used the command "

-Then it worked well.
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .parcel-cache , dist
CSS NOTES:

-Flex: becuz I wanted it to be side by side like in the header block.
-I wanted space between both the sections , so i have used (justify-content:space-between).
-I wanted to minimize the size of logo , so I had mentioned logo class with img section beside.
-To remove the bulletins , choose list-style-type:none.

--> It allows you to easily:

--> Align items horizontally or vertically

-->Control spacing and wrapping between elements

-->Make items shrink, grow, or stay fixed based on the container

-->Build responsive layouts (works great on all screen sizes)

## PROPS:

-I created one resto-card , now i want resto-cards that doesnt mean i have to print that resto card everytime..
-I can do this by creating props.
-Props are like arguments given in a function , but in the case of react it is component.
-It is a JS object , so it has to be given as an argument in the component.

## CONFIG DRIVEN UI:

-UI is drivern by config.
-For example, data can be different from place to place in a particular website.
-If you want to see the backend data of any anything , inspect > network> fetch/XXR
-Find the rest list API.

## OPTIMIZE THE APP:

-Use map function instead of loops.
-When you are using map , make sure you mention key , which is very importnat.
-Giving unique id is not acceptable.

## CLEARING UP THE FOLDER:

-I created an other folder "src" adn moved app.js into it and made changes in script line of html
-Create component folder in src and many other files can be added , to create sepeatee folder for each component.
-When a heading file is created in src , when we do that , there is no heading in app.js , so it throws an error , to correct it we have to export and then import it.
-export default Heading; (use this in heading file only)
-import it in app.js, "import Header from "./components/Heading.js";"
-Never put your hard coded in components folder(industrial advice).
-All the images link , url can be added into seperate file called utils.
-export default allows you to write only once in the file , to do multiple exports used named exports.
-To import named ones use { } these brackets.

## MAKING MY APP DYNAMIC:

FIRST FEATURE : ADDING A BUTTON THAT FILTER TOP RESTAURANTS(ABOVE 4.5 RATING)
-Firstly our application has normal js variables , if I have to make it dynamic , I have to create state variables , which can be made by using hooks like useState() , useEffect().
-First I have to import these.
-useState needs two variables one is the normal list variable , the other one is to update the list.

## Virtual DOM

- A JS-based copy of the real DOM

React uses it To perform efficient UI updates

## React Fiber

- The engine that makes rendering smarter, faster, and interruptible

## Reconciliation Algorithm

- Compares old vs new VDOM and updates real DOM efficiently

## SWIGGY API CALL:

-Used fetch() to fetch the rest list.
-async , await are used instead of promise calling.
-Then in the fetch function , I have given API link , this throws CORS error , which can be rectified by installing CORS extension.

## SHIMMER UI:

-Used to dispaly the fake cards before actually loading the data.(used for better UI experience).

## LOGIN BUTTON:

-By using useState() hook.
-React re renders everything , like if I want to change login to logout , it re renders full header page.

## SEARCH BUTTON:

-Search box and a button.
-Now, I have to create a state useState() hook.
-When the user types something, I need to remember that value, and maybe do something with it (like filter data) when they click Search , that is why create a hook.
-Whenever state variables get updated , react triggers a reconcilliation cycle(re-renders the component)
-so we create a useState hook for searcTect.
-Then we create an other hook for , restaurants list as we are using the listOfRestaurants , when we press the search button , the list sorts out with the required restaurant list , now when we have to search for an other item , we will be searching from the previously modified list , so to avoid that it's better to search from the whole list , which can be stored in the new variable.

## useEffect(): (call back functions , dependencies)

-It tells React when to re-run the effect.(Usage of dependencies)
-if there is no dependency component , it gets called on every render.
-if dependency array is empty=[] useEffect is called on intital render(just once).
-If we put something is given in dependency, every time that changes , useeEffect is called.
-useEffect(callback, [dependencies])

## HOOKS:

-never use in conditional statements.
-anad write it in the functional component like body , header , dont put it inside.
-Keep it on the top.
-useState = stores and updates data inside your component.
-useEffect = reacts to changes (like “when the data changes, run this code”).
-const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

## ROUTER:

-If you build an app with multiple “pages” (Home, About, Cart, etc.), React doesn’t know how to move between them.
-It lets you build Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the URL changes (/home, /about, /cart), but the page doesn’t reload — React just swaps components.

-React Router is much more than just creating multiple images or basic links—it is a powerful library for managing client-side routing in React applications, enabling single-page applications (SPAs) to behave like multi-page apps without full page reloads.

- Whenever u want to create a router , first thing is to build react configuration.
  -Configuration means what will happen if something is called , what will happen at the route.
  -First import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom.
  -Basically createBrowserRouter is used to create router ocnfiguration which includes path and the element to display when that path is chosen.(used to create paths)
  -Now , to reflect it on our app , we need to render it using RouterProvider.
  -First when we had to render , AppLayout component , we did it directly using root.render().

## rafce:

-It creates a boiler plate of the component.

## Error page:

-If any wrong url is taken , error page gets reloaded.

## Children routes:

-These are used to load the put the header page same and load the rest.
-Outlet is used to "use children routes in the application".

## Link component:

-If i click about us , home ....then it opens a new fresh page everytime as we are using , href link (anchor tag), which is a bad method.
-Instead usage of this link component makes it easy by not loading the whole page , which makes our application faster.
-works like anchor tag.
-Firstly , import link tag from react-dom.
-And then use it in the tags , using link component.
-Becuz of this , react applications are called as single page applications.

## Types of routing:

1. Client side routing
2. Server side routing
   -We can say that SPA's are possible by using client side routing.

## Graph QL:

-GraphQL is a query language for APIs.
-GraphQL exposes a single endpoint where clients can request exactly the data they need and nothing more.

## useParams:

-useParams is a React Router hook used to access the dynamic parameters from the current URL in a component.

## Class based components:

-Notes
-Never update state variables directly.

## API Calls using class based components:

-Notes
-refer to the life cycle diagram

## Tailwind CSS:

INSTALL PACKAGES

## Higher order components:

-Takes a component , and returns a component.
-It enhanaces or modifies the component and returns it.
-For example , if I consider swiggy it has few promoted restaurants, so now to get that , ill give input as restaurant card and give back the promoted restaurant card.
